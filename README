NAME
       murder - smart Linux process killer

       Inspired by Evan Hahn's murder script

SYNOPSIS
       murder [-hfqonc] PID|NAME|:PORT

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
	      Show help message

       -f, --force
	      Kill without confirmation

       -q, --quiet
	      Quiet mode (minimal output)

       -o, --one
	      Kill only the specified process, not the entire tree

       -c, --name-only
	      Search by process name only (not full command line)

       -n, --dry-run
	      Show what would be killed without actually killing

NOTES
       By default, murder kills the process and all its descendants. To kill
       only the specified process, use -o or --one

       In NAME mode, murder searches for NAME as a substring in the full
       command line (e.g., python matches both /usr/bin/python3 and python
       script.py). To search only in the executable name, use -c or
       --name-only

ARGUMENTS
       PID    Process ID to kill (e.g., 1234)

       NAME   Process name to kill (e.g., python, emacs, firefox)

       :PORT  Port number to kill process on (e.g., :3000)

EXAMPLES
       murder 1234
	      Kill process with PID 1234

       murder -f ruby
	      Kill all ruby processes without asking

       murder -q :3000
	      Kill process on port 3000 quietly

       murder -fq python
	      Kill python processes without asking and quietly

       murder -nf firefox
	      Show what would be killed (search by full command)

       murder -nfc firefox
	      Show what would be killed (search by name only)

       murder -nfq firefox
	      Show what would be killed with minimal output
