.SH NOTES
.SS Signal escalation
\fBmurder\fR uses graduated signals with timeouts:
.TP
\fBSIGTERM (15)\fR
.br
wait 3 seconds
.TP
\fBSIGINT  (2)\fR
.br
wait 3 seconds
.TP
\fBSIGHUP  (1)\fR
.br
wait 4 seconds
.TP
\fBSIGKILL (9)\fR
.br
no wait
.P
\fBmurder\fR verifies the process exists and hasn't been replaced (PID reuse) both before and after each signal. If the process dies during escalation, it stops sending further signals
.SS Process tree
By default, \fBmurder\fR kills the entire process tree. It finds all descendants by parsing \fI/proc/*/stat\fR and kills them in reverse order (children first). Use \fB\-o\fR to kill only the specified process
.SS Search behavior
.TP
\fBPID   mode\fR
.br
Direct kill by process ID
.TP
\fBNAME  mode\fR
.br
Searches \fBps -eo command\fR (or \fBps -eo comm\fR with \fB\-c\fR)
Matches substring, excludes itself (won't kill murder process)
.TP
\fB:PORT mode\fR
.br
Uses \fBss\fR first, falls back to \fBlsof\fR
.SH REQUIREMENTS
.TP
\fBPerl 5.005 or higher\fR
.br
Usually pre-installed on any Linux system
.TP
\fBps\fR
.br
Standard Unix tool (pre-installed)

\fBlsof\fR or \fBss\fR
.br
Optional, required only for port killing mode (:PORT)
.SH SEE ALSO
